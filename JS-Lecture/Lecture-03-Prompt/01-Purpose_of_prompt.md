# Detailed Explanation of JavaScript `prompt()`

## **1. What is `prompt()` in JavaScript?**

The `prompt()` function in JavaScript is used to display a dialog box asking the user for input. It is commonly used for simple user interactions on web pages, where you need to collect information from the user (such as name, age, preferences, etc.). Once the user provides their input and clicks "OK", the `prompt()` function returns the value entered by the user as a string. If the user clicks "Cancel", `prompt()` returns `null`.

### **Purpose of `prompt()`**:

- **User Interaction**: Collect data from the user directly through a pop-up dialog.
- **Input Validation**: Can be used to request and validate user input for various tasks.
