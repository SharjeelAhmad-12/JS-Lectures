# **Home Tasks (Lecture-2: String Methods and Number Methods)**

1. **String Length and Extraction:**  
   * Ask the user to enter their favorite quote using `prompt()`.  
   * Find and display the length of the quote.  
   * Extract the first 10 characters and display them.

2. **Check if a Word Exists in a Sentence (String Methods):**  
   * Prompt the user to input a sentence and a specific word.  
   * Use string methods like `.includes()` or `.indexOf()` to check if the word exists in the sentence.  
   * Display a message indicating whether the word is found or not.  

3. **Simple Calculator (Number Conversion and Methods):**  
   * Prompt the user to enter two numbers.  
   * Convert the input values into numbers.  
   * Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
   * Display the results formatted as integers and as decimals with 2 decimal places.

4. **Palindrome Checker (String Methods):**  
   * Ask the user to input a word.  
   * Convert the word to lowercase.  
   * Check if the word reads the same backward as forward (using `.split()`, `.reverse()`, and `.join()`).  
   * Display whether it is a palindrome or not.

5. **Find a Specific Character in a String:**  
   * Prompt the user to enter a sentence and a number.  
   * Use `.charAt()` to find the character at the position specified by the number.  
   * Print the character.

6. **Simple Average Calculation (Number Methods):**  
   * Ask the user to input three numbers (use `prompt()`).  
   * Convert them to numbers using `Number()`.  
   * Calculate the average of the three numbers.  
   * Format the result to 2 decimal places using `.toFixed()` and display it.

7. **Extract and Capitalize Initials:**  
   * Ask the user to input their full name (first, middle, and last name).  
   * Extract the initials of each name (e.g., "John Doe Smith" â†’ "JDS").  
   * Convert the initials to uppercase and display them.

8. **Check for Numbers in a String:**  
   * Prompt the user for a sentence.  
   * Check if the sentence contains any numbers using `.match()` and a regex pattern (`\d`).  
   * Print whether the sentence contains numbers and, if so, list the numbers found.

9. **Count Vowels in a Sentence:**  
   * Ask the user to input a sentence.  
   * Count the number of vowels (`a, e, i, o, u`) in the sentence (using a loop or `.match()` with regex).  
   * Print the total number of vowels.
