# **Lecture-2 (Prompt, String Methods, Number Methods)**

### **Class Tasks**

1. **Prompt and Basic String Methods:**  
   Write a program that:  
   * Prompts the user to enter their full name (first name and last name).  
   * Removes any extra spaces around the name.  
   * Converts the entire name to uppercase.  
   * Prints: "Your full name in uppercase is: [NAME]".  
       
2. **String Methods: Manipulating Words in a Sentence:**  
   * Prompt the user to input a sentence.  
   * Replace every occurrence of the word "is" in the sentence with "was".  
   * Print both the original and modified sentences.  
       
3. **Number Methods: Type Conversion and Precision:**  
   * Prompt the user to enter any number with decimal points (e.g., 23.56789).  
   * Convert the input into a number type.  
   * Round it to 2 decimal places using `.toFixed()`.  
   * Display the original number and the rounded number to the console.  

4. **String Reversal Using Methods**  
   * Prompt the user to enter a word.  
   * Reverse the word using `.split()`, `.reverse()`, and `.join()`.  
   * Print both the original word and the reversed version.  

5. **Case Comparison (Ignoring Case Sensitivity):**  
   * Prompt the user for two words.  
   * Convert both words to lowercase using `.toLowerCase()`.  
   * Check if the two words are the same (ignoring case sensitivity).  
   * Display the result in the console (e.g., "The words are the same" or "The words are different").  

6. **String and Number Manipulation Combo:**  
   * Prompt the user to input a number and their name.  
   * Repeat the name in a single string as many times as the entered number using `.repeat()`.  
   * Display the result.

Example: If the user enters `4` and `John`, the output should be: "JohnJohnJohnJohn".
