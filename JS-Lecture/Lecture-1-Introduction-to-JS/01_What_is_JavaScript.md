# `What is JavaScript?`

JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic programming language that is commonly used to make web pages interactive. It runs on the client side (in the browser) but can also run on the server side (using technologies like Node.js). JavaScript is a core technology of the web, alongside HTML and CSS, and is essential for creating modern web applications.

## `Why Use JavaScript?`
- It enables interactive elements such as buttons, forms, animations, and much more.
- JavaScript is used for both **front-end** and **back-end** development, making it a versatile language.
- It powers frameworks like React, Vue.js, and Angular, which help build complex web applications.

## `Key Features of JavaScript`
- **Dynamic typing**: Variables do not have a fixed type and can change during runtime.
- **Event-driven**: JavaScript is great for responding to user actions like clicks and form submissions.
- **Asynchronous programming**: JavaScript can handle time-consuming tasks (like fetching data) without blocking the rest of the application.

## `Where is JavaScript Used?`
- **Front-end**: Manipulating the DOM, handling events, animations.
- **Back-end**: Server-side scripting with Node.js.
- **Mobile Apps**: Using frameworks like React Native.

JavaScript is everywhere, from interactive websites to mobile apps and even server-side applications!
