# Setting Up Your Environment

To start writing JavaScript, you only need a basic text editor and a web browser. Here’s how to get started:

## `Tools You Will Need`
- **Text Editor**: 
  - [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (Recommended)
  - [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
  - [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
  
  A text editor is where you'll write your HTML and JavaScript code. Visual Studio Code is highly recommended because it has great features like syntax highlighting and code suggestions.

- **Web Browser**: 
  - Chrome, Firefox, or Edge (modern browsers support JavaScript).

  Browsers are where you'll run and test your JavaScript code. You can open an HTML file in a browser and see your JavaScript in action.

## Steps to Set Up
1. Install a text editor (e.g., VS Code).
2. Open the editor and create a new file with a `.html` extension for HTML and a `.js` extension for JavaScript.
3. Write your HTML and JavaScript code in the respective files.
4. Open the `.html` file in your browser to see your code run.

For debugging, you can use the browser’s Developer Tools (press `Ctrl + Shift + I` or `F12`) to inspect your code and view any errors.

## Optional: Install Node.js (for back-end development)
If you're interested in running JavaScript outside the browser (on the server side), you can install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). This will allow you to write and run JavaScript code on your computer using the command line.

Congratulations! You’re now set up to start learning and coding in JavaScript.
