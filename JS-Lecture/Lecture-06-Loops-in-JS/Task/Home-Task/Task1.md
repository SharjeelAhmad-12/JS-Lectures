1. **Factorial Using a While Loop**
   - Prompt the user for a number.
   - Use a `while` loop to calculate the factorial of the number.
   - Display the result.

2. **Find the Largest Number (For Loop)**
   - Create an array of numbers (e.g., `[45, 23, 78, 56, 12]`).
   - Use a `for` loop to find the largest number in the array.
   - Print the largest number.

3. **Count Digits in a Number (While Loop)**
   - Prompt the user to enter a number.
   - Use a `while` loop to count the number of digits in the number.
   - Display the count.
   
   Example: For input `3456`, output should be `4`.

4. **Display Fibonacci Sequence (For Loop)**
   - Prompt the user for the number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence.
   - Use a `for` loop to generate and display the sequence.
   
   Example: For input `5`, output should be `0, 1, 1, 2, 3`.

5. **Do While: Sum Until Negative Number**
   - Use a `do-while` loop to keep asking the user to enter numbers.
   - Add all the entered numbers until the user enters a negative number.
   - Print the total sum (exclude the negative number from the sum).

6. **Power Calculation (For Loop)**
   - Prompt the user for a base number and an exponent.
   - Use a `for` loop to calculate the result of raising the base to the power of the exponent.
   - Example: For input `base = 2` and `exponent = 3`, output should be `8`.

7. **Prime Numbers Between Two Numbers (For Loop)**
   - Ask the user to enter two numbers (a range).
   - Use a `for` loop to print all prime numbers between the two numbers.

8. **Guessing Game (Do While Loop)**
   - Generate a random number between 1 and 10.
   - Use a `do-while` loop to keep prompting the user to guess the number until they get it right.
   - After a correct guess, display how many attempts it took.

9. **Nested Loop Pattern (For Loop)**
   - Write a program to print the following pattern using nested `for` loops:
   
       ```javascript
        *
        **
        ***
        ****
        *****
    ```

10. **Reverse a Number (While Loop)**
    - Prompt the user to enter a number.
    - Use a `while` loop to reverse the digits of the number.
    - Display the reversed number.
    
    Example: Input `123` should output `321`.

11. **Check Palindrome (For Loop)**
    - Prompt the user to enter a string.
    - Use a `for` loop to check if the string is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).
    - Print `true` or `false`.
    
    Example: Input `"madam"` outputs `true`; input `"hello"` outputs `false`.

12. **Count Numbers Divisible by 2 or 5 (For Loop)**
    - Write a program to count how many numbers between 1 and 100 are divisible by either 2 or 5 using a `for` loop.
    - Display the count.

13. **Print Numbers Until Condition (Do While Loop)**
    - Use a `do-while` loop to keep printing numbers, starting from 1, until their sum exceeds 50.
    - Display all the printed numbers and the total sum.

14. **Factorial Using a For Loop**
    - Prompt the user for a number.
    - Use a `for` loop to calculate the factorial of the number.
    - Display the result.
    
    Example: Input `5` should output `120` (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).

15. **Find First Multiple of 7 in a Range (While Loop)**
    - Write a program that starts from 1 and finds the first number greater than or equal to 50 that is divisible by 7.
    - Use a `while` loop.

16. **Nested Loop: Diamond Pattern**
    - Write a program using nested `for` loops to print a diamond pattern like this:
    
    ```javascript
         *
        ***
       *****
        ***
         *
    ```

17. **Guess the Number Game (While Loop)**
    - Use a `while` loop to simulate a guessing game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 20.
    - The program provides feedback (`too high` or `too low`) until the correct number is guessed.

18. **Print Squares of Numbers (Do While Loop)**
    - Use a `do-while` loop to print the squares of numbers from 1 to 10.

19. **Reverse a String (For Loop)**
    - Prompt the user to enter a string.
    - Use a `for` loop to reverse the string.
    - Display the reversed string.
    
    Example: Input `"hello"` outputs `"olleh"`.

20. **Find Smallest and Largest Numbers (For Loop)**
    - Prompt the user to enter 5 numbers.
    - Use a `for` loop to find and display the smallest and largest numbers.
