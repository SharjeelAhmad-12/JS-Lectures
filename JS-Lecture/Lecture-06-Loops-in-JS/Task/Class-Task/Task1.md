### **Class Tasks**

1. **Sum of Numbers Using a For Loop**
   - Write a program that calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100 using a `for` loop.
   - Display the result.

2. **Print Even Numbers (While Loop)**
   - Use a `while` loop to print all even numbers between 1 and 20.
   - Display each number in the console.

3. **Do While: User Input Until "Stop"**
   - Write a program that keeps prompting the user to enter text until they type "stop."
   - Use a `do-while` loop.
   - Print all inputs entered before "stop."

4. **Multiplication Table (For Loop)**
   - Prompt the user to enter a number.
   - Use a `for` loop to print the multiplication table for that number from 1 to 10.

5. **Reverse Counting (While Loop)**
   - Write a program to print numbers from 10 to 1 in reverse order using a `while` loop.

6. **Sum of Odd Numbers (For Loop)**
   - Write a program that calculates the sum of all odd numbers between 1 and 50 using a `for` loop.
   - Display the sum.

7. **Sum of Numbers Divisible by 3 (For Loop)**
   - Write a program that calculates the sum of all numbers between 1 and 50 that are divisible by 3 using a `for` loop.
   - Display the sum.

8. **Print Alternate Numbers (While Loop)**
   - Use a `while` loop to print every second number from 1 to 20 (e.g., 1, 3, 5, 7, ...).
   - Display each number in the console.

9. **Count Vowels in a String (For Loop)**
   - Prompt the user to enter a string.
   - Use a `for` loop to count and display the total number of vowels (`a, e, i, o, u`) in the string.

10. **Nested Loop: Multiplication Table for Numbers 1-5**
    - Use nested `for` loops to display multiplication tables for numbers 1 to 5.
    - Each table should show multiples from 1 to 10.

11. **Sum of Digits in a Number (While Loop)**
    - Prompt the user to enter a number.
    - Use a `while` loop to calculate the sum of the digits of the number.
    - Display the result.
    
    Example: For input `123`, the output should be `6` (1 + 2 + 3).

12. **Print All Characters of a String (Do While Loop)**
    - Prompt the user to enter a string.
    - Use a `do-while` loop to print each character of the string on a new line.
