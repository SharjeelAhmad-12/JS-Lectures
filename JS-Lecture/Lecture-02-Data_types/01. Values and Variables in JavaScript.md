# 01.` Values and Variables in JavaScript`

## ``Introduction`
`
In JavaScript, **variables** are used to store values. A variable holds a reference to a value, which can be either a **primitive data type** (like a number or string) or a **non-primitive data type** (like an object or array). Understanding how to declare and assign values to variables is one of the first steps in learning JavaScript.

In this guide, we will explore:
1. What values are.
2. The difference between primitive and non-primitive values.
3. JavaScript data types and their usage.
4. How to assign values to variables using `let`, `const`, and `var`.

## `What are Values?`

A **value** is any data that can be stored in a variable. JavaScript values can be categorized into two main types:

1. **Primitive values** (also known as **primitive data types**)
2. **Non-primitive values** (also known as **reference data types**)

### `Variables and Values`

A **variable** is a named container for storing a value. In JavaScript, you can create a variable using the `let`, `const`, or `var` keyword. Once a variable is declared, it can hold any value, and you can later change the value stored in it.

In JavaScript, you do **not** need to explicitly declare the data type of a variable. The JavaScript engine automatically detects the data type based on the value assigned to the variable. This is called **dynamic typing**.

For example:

```javascript
let number = 42;      // The JavaScript engine understands that 'number' is a Number type
let name = "Alice";   // 'name' is a String type
let isActive = true;  // 'isActive' is a Boolean type


JavaScript provides three keywords to declare variables:
1. **`var`** (older, less commonly used)
2. **`let`** (preferred for variables that can change)
3. **`const`** (used for variables that should not change)

## **Difference Between `let`, `var`, and `const`**

| **`Feature`**         | **`var`**                     | **`let`**                     | **`const`**                  |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Scope**           | Function-scoped               | Block-scoped                  | Block-scoped                |
| **Reassignment**    | Allowed                       | Allowed                       | Not allowed                 |
| **Hoisting**        | Hoisted but initialized as `undefined` | Hoisted but not initialized  | Hoisted but not initialized |
| **Usage**           | Older, not recommended        | Preferred for variables that can change | Used for constants that donâ€™t change |
