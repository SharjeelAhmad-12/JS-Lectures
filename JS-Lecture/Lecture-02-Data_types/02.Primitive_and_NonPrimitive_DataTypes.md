# 02. `Primitive and Non-Primitive Data Types in JavaScript`

## `Introduction`
In JavaScript, **data types** are the foundation of every program. They define the kind of data a variable can store and how that data behaves. Data types in JavaScript are broadly categorized into:

1. **Primitive Data Types**
2. **Non-Primitive Data Types**
Understanding the differences between these categories is essential for writing efficient and reliable code.
---
## **Primitive Data Types**
### **Definition**
Primitive data types are the most basic types of data in JavaScript. They are **immutable**, meaning their values cannot be changed once created.
---
### **Types of Primitive Data**
1. **Number**
2. **String**
3. **Boolean**
4. **Undefined**
5. **Null**
6. **Symbol**
7. **BigInt**
#### **1. Number**
Represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers.
**Examples:**
```javascript
let age = 25;      // Integer
let price = 19.99; // Floating-point
let infinity = Infinity; // Special value



# 03. `Non-Primitive Data Types in JavaScript`

## `Introduction`

In JavaScript, **non-primitive data types** are used to store collections of data or more complex entities. Unlike primitive data types, they are **mutable**, meaning their content can be changed after creation. Non-primitive data types are also known as **reference types** because they are stored in memory as references.
---
## `**What are Non-Primitive Data Types?**`
Non-primitive data types can hold multiple values and are not predefined. They include:
1. **Object**
2. **Array**
3. **Function**
These types enable developers to model and manipulate complex data structures.
---
## **1. Objects**
### **Definition**
An **object** is a collection of properties. Each property is a key-value pair, where the key is a string (or `Symbol`), and the value can be any data type.
### **Syntax**
javascript

let objectName = {
  key1: value1,
  key2: value2,
  // Additional key-value pairs
};



# 04. Difference Between Primitive and Non-Primitive Data Types in JavaScript

## **Introduction**

JavaScript data types are broadly categorized into **Primitive** and **Non-Primitive** types. The table below highlights the key differences between these two categories, helping developers understand their behaviors and use cases.
---
## **Difference Table: Primitive vs Non-Primitive Data Types**
| **`Aspect`**              | **`Primitive Data Types`**                      | **`Non-Primitive Data Types`**                |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**          | Single, simple, and immutable values.        | Complex, mutable structures that store collections or entities. |
| **Examples**            | Numbers, Strings, Booleans, Null, Undefined, Symbol, BigInt. | Objects, Arrays, Functions.                |
| **Mutability**          | Immutable (values cannot be changed).        | Mutable (values can be modified).           |
| **Storage**             | Stored directly in memory (stack).           | Stored by reference in memory (heap).       |
| **Passing Behavior**    | Passed by value (copies of values are made). | Passed by reference (references are copied).|
| **Memory Usage**        | Requires less memory due to simplicity.      | Requires more memory as they store references. |
| **Behavior on Assignment** | Creates a new copy of the value.            | Both variables point to the same reference. |
| **Usage**               | For basic, straightforward data handling.    | For storing and managing complex data structures. |

## **Examples**

### **Primitive Example**

javascript
let a = 10;
let b = a; // Copy of value is assigned
b = 20;
console.log(a); // Output: 10
console.log(b); // Output: 20
